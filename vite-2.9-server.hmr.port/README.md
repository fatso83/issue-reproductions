# Repro case for Vite 2.9 capturing server.hmr.port

## EDIT: working solution from the Vite bug tracker
Seems like this was working due to relying on some undocumented bug in Vite
that was recently fixed. Lucky for me, someone posted a workaround in the 
[issue I created (#7562)](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/7562).

Using that fix the port is no longer captured.

## Automatic test

$ npm t

## Showing it worked in Vite 2.8
```
npm i vite@2.8
npm t

# Manual reproduction:

In one window, do `npx vite`. It should say something like:
```
  vite v2.9.1 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:15888/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 114ms.
```

Now verify it is running on port 13001                  
```
# This is netstat on GNU. BSD will be slightly different
$ netstat -tapn | grep 13001
tcp6       0      0 :::13001                :::*                    LISTEN      1123181/node
```

It did not use to do this
