# Repro case for Vite 2.9 capturing server.hmr.port

## Automatic test

```
$ npm t

> vite-2.9-server.hmr.port@1.0.0 test
> ./test.sh

Firing up Vite ...
(!) Could not auto-determine entry point from rollupOptions or html files and there are no explicit optimizeDeps.include patterns. Skipping dependency pre-bundling.
Stopping the background process (1134474)

ðŸ˜¢ Vite has captured port server.hmr.port (13001)

Finished!
Terminert
```

## Showing it worked in Vite 2.8
```
npm i vite@2.8
npm t

> vite-2.9-server.hmr.port@1.0.0 test
> ./test.sh

Firing up Vite ...
Stopping the background process (1133689)

ðŸ˜Š Nothing listens on server.hmr.port. As G*d/Evan intended!

Finished!
Terminert
```


# Manual reproduction:

In one window, do `npx vite`. It should say something like:
```
  vite v2.9.1 dev server running at:

  > Local: http://localhost:15888/
  > Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 114ms.
```

Now verify it is running on port 13001                  
```
# This is netstat on GNU. BSD will be slightly different
$ netstat -tapn | grep 13001
tcp6       0      0 :::13001                :::*                    LISTEN      1123181/node
```

It did not use to do this
